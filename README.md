# chromosome_karyotyping
In this research, we have developed a system designed to assist in the meticulous task of identifying and categorizing chromosomes within the context of karyotyping, an essential process in the field of genetics and medical diagnosis. 

This system offers several significant advantages. First, it operates swiftly, significantly reducing the time required for chromosome analysis. Second, it excels in accuracy, minimizing errors that can occur during manual analysis.

The potential applications of this system are far-reaching, benefitting both clinical geneticists and researchers. Medical professionals can rely on it to better understand genetic conditions and provide more accurate diagnoses, while researchers can accelerate their studies involving genetics.
